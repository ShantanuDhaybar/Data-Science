# Data-Science

This repository having the popular Python libraries Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and seaboron to perform data analysis on a various dataset. The dataset contains information about various data. The goal of this project is to explore the data and gain insights and make the predictions.

The project consists of several Jupyter Notebooks that cover different aspects of the data analysis process. The notebooks use Pandas to load and manipulate the dataset, NumPy to perform mathematical operations on the data, and Matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations that help to understand the data.

## Some of the topics covered in the notebooks include:

- Data cleaning and preparation: removing missing values, handling duplicates, and transforming data types.

- Exploratory data analysis: calculating descriptive statistics, plotting histograms, and creating scatter plots to understand the relationships between variables.
- Predictive modeling: building a machine learning model to predict sales based on historical data.

## Installation (Jupyter Notebook)

- Go to the Anaconda website and click the "Download" button for the version of Anaconda you want to install (e.g. Windows, macOS, or Linux).

```bash
  https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
```
- Once the download is complete, double-click on the installer file to launch the Anaconda installer.

- Follow the instructions in the installer to complete the installation process. By default, Anaconda will be installed in the directory /anaconda on your system.

- Once the installation is complete, open the Anaconda Navigator by searching for it in your applications or by typing "anaconda-navigator" in your terminal.

- In the Anaconda Navigator, click on the "Launch" button under the Jupyter Notebook icon to launch Jupyter.

- Jupyter Notebook will open in your default browser. From here, you can create a new notebook, open an existing notebook, or run code in the notebook.

## (Google Colab)

- Google Colab (short for "Colaboratory") is a free cloud-based platform that provides a Jupyter Notebook environment for running Python code and machine learning models. It allows users to access powerful computing resources and collaborate with others in real-time.

```bash

## Roadmap

- Learn Numpy
- Learn Pandas
- Learn Matplotlib and Seaboarn (Data Visualization Libraries)
- Build Projects
