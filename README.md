# Data-Science
This repository having the popular Python libraries Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and seaboron to perform data analysis on a various dataset. The dataset contains information about various data. The goal of this project is to explore the data and gain insights and make the predictions.

The project consists of several Jupyter Notebooks that cover different aspects of the data analysis process. The notebooks use Pandas to load and manipulate the dataset, NumPy to perform mathematical operations on the data, and Matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations that help to understand the data.

Some of the topics covered in the notebooks include:

    1) Data cleaning and preparation: removing missing values, handling duplicates, and transforming data types.
    2) Exploratory data analysis: calculating descriptive statistics, plotting histograms, and creating scatter plots to understand    
       the relationships between variables.
    3) Predictive modeling: building a machine learning model to predict sales based on historical data.
