# NumPy

NumPy (short for "Numerical Python") is a powerful Python library for scientific computing that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is widely used in the scientific and engineering communities for tasks such as data analysis, machine learning, and numerical simulations.
## Some of the topics covered in this notebook include:

- Support for arrays with multiple dimensions 

- efficient numerical operations on arrays, including element-wise operations and matrix operations

- Broadcasting functionality for performing operations on arrays with different shapes and sizes

- Fast and efficient implementation of mathematical functions, such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponentials.

- Tools for working with linear algebra, Fourier analysis, and random number generation.
## Install Numpy 

Type the following command and press Enter to install NumPy:

```bash
  pip install numpy
```
### Note: 
If you are using a Python distribution such as Anaconda or Miniconda, NumPy may already be pre-installed. In that case, you can skip the above steps and start using NumPy directly,

```bash
  import numpy as np 
```
