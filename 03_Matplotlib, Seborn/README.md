# Matplotlib and Seaborn

Matplotlib is a popular Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in a wide variety of formats. It provides a low-level interface for creating plots, allowing users to have fine-grained control over the appearance of their visualizations. Matplotlib supports a wide range of plot types, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more.

Seaborn, on the other hand, is a Python library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a higher-level interface for creating statistical visualizations. Seaborn is specifically designed for working with structured data, and it includes built-in support for many common statistical plots, such as box plots, violin plots, and heatmaps. Seaborn also includes functionality for color palettes, grouping and aggregation of data, and more advanced statistical visualizations.

Both Matplotlib and Seaborn are powerful tools for data visualization in Python, and they can be used together to create complex and informative visualizations. Matplotlib provides a great deal of flexibility and control over the appearance of visualizations, while Seaborn provides a higher-level interface for working with structured data and creating statistical visualizations.






## Some of the topics covered in this notebook include:

- Multiple Plot Types: Matplotlib provides a wide variety of plot types, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, pie charts, histograms, and more.

- Statistical Visualization: Seaborn is specifically designed for creating statistical visualizations, including box plots, violin plots, heatmaps, and more.

- Integration: Matplotlib and Seaborn can be easily integrated with other Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, including NumPy and Pandas.

## Install Matplotlib and Seaborn 

Type the following command and press Enter to install matplotlib and seaborn:

```bash
  pip install matplotlib
  
  pip install seaborn

```
### Note: 
If you are using a Python distribution such as Anaconda or Miniconda, matplotlib and seaborn may already be pre-installed. In that case, you can skip the above steps and start using matplotlib and seaborn directly,

```bash
  import matplotlib.pyplot as sns 

  import seaborn as sns
```
