# Pandas

Pandas is a popular open-source library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for handling structured data, such as spreadsheets and relational databases.

Pandas is built on top of NumPy, another popular library for numerical computing in Python, and it extends NumPy's capabilities by providing a high-level interface for working with tabular data. Pandas has two main data structures, Series and DataFrame, which allow users to easily manipulate and analyze data.

With Pandas, you can perform a wide variety of data manipulation tasks, such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, merging, and reshaping data. It also includes powerful data visualization capabilities to help you explore and communicate your findings.
## Some of the topics covered in this notebook include:

- DataFrame: This is a two-dimensional table-like data structure, where each column can have a different data type. It allows for easy manipulation of data, including filtering, sorting, merging, and pivoting.

- Series: This is a one-dimensional array-like data structure, where each element can have a different data type. It's useful for working with time series data or other data that can be represented as a sequence.

- Data visualization: Pandas provides data visualization capabilities, including plotting, histogramming, and box plotting.
## Install Numpy 

Type the following command and press Enter to install pandas:

```bash
  pip install pandas
```
### Note: 
If you are using a Python distribution such as Anaconda or Miniconda, pandas may already be pre-installed. In that case, you can skip the above steps and start using pandas directly,

```bash
  import pandas as pd 
```
